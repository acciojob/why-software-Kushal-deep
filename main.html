	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I have always been fascinated by technology and how software can solve real-world problems efficiently. From a young age, I enjoyed breaking down problems and finding logical solutions, which naturally led me toward programming. As I started learning software development, I realized that itâ€™s not just about coding, but about creating impactful solutions that improve people's lives.

"I am particularly drawn to full-stack development because it allows me to build applications from end to end, turning ideas into functional products. My skills in JavaScript, Data Structures, and Web Development have helped me develop projects that strengthen my technical foundation.
